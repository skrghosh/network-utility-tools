- **Subnet Mask to CIDR Conversion**: Convert subnet masks to CIDR notation and vice versa.
- **Subnet Calculator**: Calculate network information based on IP address and subnet mask or CIDR notation.
- **Reverse DNS Lookup**: Find the domain name associated with an IP address.
- **Ping Utility**: Check the reachability of a host by sending ICMP echo requests.
